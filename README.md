# Taiko
(todo: get a more interesting name)
A Taiko no tatsujin clone/simulator. I'm contractually obliged to mention it's written in rust.

This is still under construction. My goals for this project are to create a taiko-style rhythm game that can read and play songs using the tja format. It can't
play anything yet.

## Goals
Current goals
- [x] Parse tja files (ideally, in a way that can efficiently load many songs)
- [ ] Create a working prototype that can play basic taiko mode songs
- [ ] Handle input: keyboard/tatacon/general input configuration settings
- [ ] Handle multiplayer

Possible future goals, but not a current priority:
- Skinning
- Port to web
- Read and play osu taiko format
- Create a TJA editor in the game (this would be extremely difficult but sorely needed)
